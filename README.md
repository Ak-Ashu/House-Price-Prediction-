# House Price Prediction System  

## Overview  
A machine learning-based system that predicts real estate property values using data-driven analysis. It leverages Flask APIs for backend processing and a responsive frontend interface for user interaction.  

## Features  
- Predicts house prices using **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest**.  
- **Flask-based API** for backend computations.  
- **User-friendly web interface** for easy property input and price estimation.  
- **Data visualization** for market trends and comparative analysis.  
- **Security measures** including API authentication and encryption.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python, Flask** (backend)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS** (frontend)  
- **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy** (machine learning)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
  https://github.com/Ak-Ashu/House-Price-Prediction-
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run Flask server:  
   ```sh
   python app.py  
   ```  

## Usage  
- Enter property details in the web interface.  
- Click "Predict" to get an estimated price.  
- View insights on **market trends and property comparisons**.  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of real-time market APIs to refine predictions.
- Advanced deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Cloud-based deployment for better scalability.
